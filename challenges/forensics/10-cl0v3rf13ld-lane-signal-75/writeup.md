# WriteUp - 10 Cl0v3rf13ld Lane Signal

If you start do dissect the unknown file you will quickly find that it is a concatenation of three files.

 + the first one is a jpeg cover a a famous film
 + the second one is png file illustrating morse code
 + and the third file is an OGG file which contains... guess what... A MORSE SIGNAL.

Just split the file in three files. Then listen to the OGG file and use the morse picture to decode it.

The morse code used for this challenge is right [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code#Letters.2C_numbers.2C_punctuation.2C_prosigns_for_Morse_code_and_non-English_variants). 
Yes, morse code can be interpreted using various alphabets.

You'll get the flag.
