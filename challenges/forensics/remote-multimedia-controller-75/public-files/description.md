# Remote Multimedia Controller

Caasi Vosima organized a party last night to show is new high-tech house to his 
friends yet something went wrong with the multimedia player and the music was 
turned off.

It took some time to restart the music player and the party was like frozen for a 
moment. Caasi was able to recover some information collected just before the 
crash.

Help Caasi to find out what happened !
